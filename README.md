In order to give users a more humane and more convenient experience, as the entrance of the polkadot network, the user is provided with more intuitive visual data and status change display to guarantee the user's right to know and network participation.


- Users can add assets, support Relaychain and Parachain to transfer, receive, and view the transfer history and state. Have the visual asset change analysis chart, make it easier for users to analyze assets. Users are notified when they receive the asset and can view the transfer details data.

  The private key is self-owned, and have the Gesture,Fingerprint, Facial recognition, Hot and cold wallet mechanism, users can set their own scheme. Our team is developing a new encryption scheme -- high - dimensional fractal encryption, will be used to safeguard the security of a user using the polkawallet.

Users can governance directly from polkawallet and view the history governance records. So polkawallet also improves public Referenda engagement.

> What are the business barriers of Polkawallet?  

No, only named Polkawallet, it's a brand effect. This means that there may be countless better competitors. We also want to see more excellent competitors.

> How can Polkawallet maintain development?

We got grants from Web3 Foundation, at the same time, we are helping Acala Network to develop convenient mobile interactions. In the future we want to actively join the ParaDAO that Acala Network is launching, this can be a way for many ecological projects to come together. Through ParaDAO, infrastructures such as Polkawallet and Parachain projects all have clear maintenance development plans.
